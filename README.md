This server-side mod allows you to hide any mob from any player, also making it so that the mob no longer targets that player. 

This is intended for server admins that want to provide an arachnophobia mode for their server but don't want to disable spiders for all members.

Unfortunately, this doesn't disable the audio for that mob.

You can use this mod with the `/termination add/remove [player] [entity]` command.
